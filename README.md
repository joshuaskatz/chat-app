This is a GraphQL API with basic social media functionality. It allows for sending, accepting, and deleting friend requests, as well as private messaging other users on your friends list in chatroom's where multiple users can connect.

This project uses PostgreSQL as the database, TypeORM as the ORM, and also includes test suites for the resolvers through Jest.

There will also be a client side for this small app created with React.
